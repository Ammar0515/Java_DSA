>>>Condition for type conversion
1. the two types should be compatible 
ex. adding an int and it will automaticlly convert it into float.
 int value is 65 & and output will be 65.0. 
2. the dastination value should be greater than the source value.

>>> Type promotion rules
1. All the byte, short & character values are promoted into int 
and then any oprands(+,-,*,/) is long whole opration will be promoted 
to long.
